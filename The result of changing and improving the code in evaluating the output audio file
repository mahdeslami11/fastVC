Loss of focus shows how clean the alignments are. This is our final assessment
To listen to a sample of 20 sentences produced from Harvard Sentences 5 (included in
Appendix) and do a subjective assessment. Some insights:
1. M1 is clearly unable to generalize well, given that attentional alignments are not convergent.

Quality and clarity of pronunciation compared to M4 and M5 models. Model
The M4 looks distinctly better than the others, with lower artifacts and sharper articulation.

We acknowledge that this is an informal way of evaluating compared to the typical average
Opinion Score (MOS) used in collective literature via Amazon Mechanical Turk. However, with
